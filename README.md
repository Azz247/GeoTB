## What is GeoTB ? <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azz247/GeoTB/main/man/figures/treasure-map.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

GeoTB is a website created to showcase the results of an ecological
study on the spatial patterns of tuberculosis (TB) at the sub-district
level in Mueang Khon Kaen District. The study aims to identify and
visualize the geographic distribution of TB cases to better understand
the disease’s impact in this area.

## 📌 Why study in Mueang Khon Kaen district ?

Thailand is one of the 30 countries with the highest TB burden globally.
Within Thailand, Khon Kaen Province ranks second for the highest
estimated TB burden, following Bangkok. Our data analysis revealed that
Mueang Khon Kaen District has the highest TB notification rate in Khon
Kaen Province. This finding underscores the importance of focusing on
this district to identify and analyze the spatial patterns of TB.

## Why have to build website ?

The GeoTB website was developed using the `pkgdown (version 2.0.7)`
package in RStudio, featuring an interactive map created primarily with
the `leaflet (version 1.9.4)` package. The website is designed to
facilitate easier access to and understanding of the ecological study’s
context, with a particular emphasis on the map figures. Additional
statistical analyses were performed using the `GeoDa (version 1.22)`
program, and these results are also presented on the website.
