## What is GeoTB ? <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azz247/GeoTB/main/man/figures/treasure-map.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

ã…¤GeoTB is a website created to showcase the results of an ecological
study on the spatial patterns of tuberculosis (TB) at the sub-district
level in Mueang Khon Kaen District. The study aims to identify and
visualize the geographic distribution of TB cases to better understand
the diseaseâ€™s impact in this area.

## ðŸ“Œ Why study in Mueang Khon Kaen district ?

ã…¤Thailand is one of the 30 countries with the highest TB burden
globally. Within Thailand, Khon Kaen Province ranks second for the
highest estimated TB burden, following Bangkok. Our data analysis
revealed that Mueang Khon Kaen District has the highest TB notification
rate in Khon Kaen Province. This finding underscores the importance of
focusing on this district to identify and analyze the spatial patterns
of TB.

## Why have to build website ?

ã…¤The GeoTB website was developed using `pkgdown (version 2.0.7)`
package in RStudio. It is designed to present the context of an
ecological study, with a particular focus on the interactive map, which
was created primarily with the `leaflet (version 1.9.4)` package.
Additional statistical analyses were performed using the
`GeoDa (version 1.22)` program, and these results are also presented on
the website.
