## What is GeoTB ?

This website was built to present the results of an ecological study on
the spatial pattern detection of tuberculosis at the sub-district level
in Mueang Khon Kaen District.

## Why study in Mueang Khon Kaen district ?

Thailand is among the 30 countries with the highest burden of TB
worldwide. In Thailand, Khon Kaen Province has the second-highest
estimated TB burden after Bangkok. After reviewing the data, Mueang Khon
Kaen District was found to have the highest TB notification rate in Khon
Kaen. This is why we aimed to identify the spatial patterns of TB in
Mueang Khon Kaen District.

## Why have to build website ?

This website was built and designed using the
`pkgdown (version 2.1.0 package)` in RStudio to present an interactive
map created primarily with the `leaflet (version 2.2.2)` package. This
makes it easier to access and understand the context of the ecological
study. Other statistical analyses were conducted and presented using the
`GeoDa (version 1.22)` program, and the results are showcased on this
website.
