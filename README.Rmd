## Description 
	Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most infectious diseases and a leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. It continues to be a significant problem for global public health. A 2023 WHO report reveals that over 10 million people are infected with TB globally each year. In response the World Health Organization (WHO) has set a goal to significantly reduce the global TB incidence rate by 2030.
	
 	Thailand is among the 30 countries with the highest burden of TB. The National Tuberculosis Report in Thailand 2021 indicates that Khon Kaen province has the second-highest estimated TB burden after Bangkok. In 2022, the estimated TB incidence rate in Thailand was 155 persons per 100,000 population, exceeding the global estimated rate of 133 persons per 100,000 population.
 	
	Tuberculosis is an airborne disease that spreads when an infected person expels the bacteria into the air. This puts people nearby at increased risk of TB infection. Therefore, predicting risk areas has the potential to improve prevention and disease control plans, especially when resources and budget allocation are limited. A 2022 ecological study on tuberculosis in Thailand found that risk factors influencing the incidence rate of tuberculosis vary across provinces. According to a review of the literature, there are no existing ecological studies on tuberculosis at the district and sub-district levels in Thailand. This study aims to predict risk areas at the sub-district level in Khon Kaen and identify risk factors influencing the incidence rate of tuberculosis.

## Justification
	Limited spatiotemporal data exists concerning tuberculosis in Thailand, and studies examining the disease at the sub-district level are lacking. This study aims to describe the demographic attributes of people with tuberculosis, identify spatial clusters at the sub-district level in Khon Kaen, and identify risk factors influencing the incidence rate of tuberculosis within these areas. 

## Research questions
  How is tuberculosis distributed at the sub-district level in Khon Kaen, and what are the associated risk factors contributing to its incidence?

## Study design 
  Ecological study.
  
## Objectives of the study
	Primary objective: To describe the demographic attributes of people with tuberculosis at the sub-district level in Khon Kaen.
	Secondary objective: To identify risk factors influencing the incidence rate of tuberculosis at the sub-district level in Khon Kaen.
	
## Expected benefits and application
	The findings of this research could inform targeted public health interventions, leading to more effective prevention and disease control strategies.
